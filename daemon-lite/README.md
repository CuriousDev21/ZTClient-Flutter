# daemon-lite

This archive contains the daemon used for the interview of Cloudflare Zero Trust
Client GUI.

The `daemon-lite` daemon is provided pre-compiled for convenience.

The `daemon-lite-src` folder contains the source code for the daemon, should the
candidates wish to inspect the source code, or compile the binary themselves.
